Scratch is a visual programming environment created at MIT[^1] specifically for children and beginners. Instead of writing complex text code, it uses colorful blocks that snap together like LEGO bricks.

It's the perfect introduction to the world of programming for children. Scratch helps beginners understand the basics of algorithms without the intimidation of parentheses and commas, and it serves as a visual tool for teachers to teach computer science.

Looking at the abundance of bright images, it might seem like just a game. But Scratch actually teaches the most important thing: logic. Behind the colorful blocks lie important concepts: loops, variables, conditional statements, and data arrays. Scratch can be used to create not only simple cartoons but also multi-level games with physics and pseudo-3D graphics, interactive presentations, and educational tools. In Scratch, you can implement advanced encryption algorithms or AI-powered programs, such as chatbots. By connecting external devices, you can even control robotic arms or explore smart home systems. Having mastered block logic, beginning developers can more easily transition to text-based languages ​​like Python, JavaScript, or Go.

Furthermore, over the years, Scratch has united a global community of creators. By programming here, children learn not just to "move a cat," but to bring ideas to life, learn from others' experiences, and share their projects with millions of users worldwide.
